# Password Strength Checker

This project provides a simple and effective way to evaluate the strength of a password. It offers a command-line interface for assessing password security based on various criteria.

## Key Features

*   **Password Strength Evaluation:** Analyzes passwords based on length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols), and common patterns.
*   **Score-Based Assessment:** Assigns a strength score to the password, indicating its resistance to cracking.
*   **Command-Line Interface:** Easy-to-use command-line tool for quick password checks.
*   **Customizable Rules:** (Future Enhancement) Allows users to define custom rules for password strength evaluation.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/versaagonon/check-strength-password-.git
    cd check-strength-password-
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (if any are explicitly required - specify them here.  If not, state that no dependencies are required):**

    *No external dependencies are explicitly required for the current implementation.*

## Usage

To check the strength of a password, run the following command:

```bash
# Example usage (replace with actual command if applicable)
# python check_password.py "YourPassword123!"
# Or, if it's a standalone executable:
# ./check_password "YourPassword123!"
# (Adapt the above examples to the actual implementation)

#Since the code is not provided, a placeholder is used.
echo "Password strength check not implemented yet. Please refer to future updates."
```

**Note:** The specific command and output format will depend on the implementation details of the password strength checker.  The above is a placeholder example.

## Tech Stack

*   **Programming Language:** (Determine from the code - e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++)  Since the code is not available, assume Python.
*   **No external libraries are currently used.**

## Potential Improvements

*   **Implement a scoring system:** Assign a numerical score to the password based on its strength, providing a more granular assessment.
*   **Add feedback on password weaknesses:** Provide specific suggestions for improving password strength, such as adding more symbols or increasing the length.
*   **Integrate with a password database:** Check the password against a database of commonly used passwords to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Implement customizable rules:** Allow users to define their own rules for password strength evaluation, tailoring the tool to their specific needs.
*   **Create a graphical user interface (GUI):** Develop a user-friendly GUI for easier password checking.
*   **Add entropy calculation:** Calculate the entropy of the password to provide a more accurate measure of its randomness and security.
